Basic brick Break game
This is BRICK bREAKER program is made by Sahil Singh.

In detail:
This projct was initally made in 2018 as part of my Primary High School Project(10th grade basically ). 
Brick breaker is just another section in the project.
There were other games as well but I lost them. So I decided to just remake them and store it for other learners.

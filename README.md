# Brick-Break
Basic brick Break game
This is the BRICK bREAKER program made by Sahil Singh.

In detail:
This project was initially made in 2018 as part of my Primary High School Project(10th grade basically ). 
Brickbreaker is just another section in the project.
There were other games as well but I lost them. So I decided to just remake them and store it for other learners. 
You are free to add features to these (I'll make a list of features I want to implement below).
Use the code to your preferences for learning. Good luck :D

Features to implement;
-Adding themes 
-Randomizing the brick positions
-Adding levels
